\subsection{Price discrimination principles}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If demand curves are different, it is more profitable to set diferent prices in diferent markets.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The price should be higher in the market with more inelastic demand.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item Arbitrage (makes the prices in the two markets closer together) makes it more difficult to price discriminate. 
\end{enumerate} 


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Markets can be segmented in more ways than geographically}
By segmenting the market you can price discriminate. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Masouses
    \item Movie theaters
    \item Computer Software 
    \item Airlines 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discrimination is hard}
Distinglishing between market segments are hard and difcult to determine, but when they are determined is because of a caracteristics.
